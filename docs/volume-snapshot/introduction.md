**StackBill volume snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of the data stored on a storage volume or disk. It's a mechanism used to create a backup or a copy of the data in case of a disaster or data loss.

A volume snapshot captures the state of the data at the time the snapshot is taken, which allows users to restore data to that particular point in time. This is useful in scenarios where you want to revert to an earlier state of the data or recover deleted data.
