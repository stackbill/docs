- The purpose of **Security groups in StackBill CMP** is to isolate traffic to virtual machines.

- Security groups are groups of virtual machines that filter their traffic based on ingress and egress rules.

- According to these rules, network traffic is filtered according to the IP address trying to communicate with the virtual machine.

- The use of security groups is especially useful in zones using basic networking, since all guest VMs have their own network.

- The KVM hypervisor is the only hypervisor that supports security groups in advanced zones.
