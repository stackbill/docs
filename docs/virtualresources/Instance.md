# Getting Started


**[StackBill](https://www.stackbill.com/)** Instances are running on virtualized hardware. You can use them standalone or as part of larger, cloud-based infrastructures.

Users can **start, stop, reboot, and destroy** their own created virtual machines in **[Stackbill CMP](https://youtu.be/wwOL091GyFM)**, by giving them complete control over their cloud-based virtual machines.

- There are two types of instance deployment types available in the **StackBill Cloud Management Portal.**  

   [Quick Deploy](./Instance#quick-deploy-in-stackbill-cmp)  |   [Advanced Deploy](./Instance#advanced-deploy-in-stackbill-cmp)



- The main difference between these two deployments is that **quick deployment** is mainly for novice users **who have very limited knowledge of cloud computing.**

- A user with **good knowledge of cloud technology can use advance deploy in StackBill CMP.**
