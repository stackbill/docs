### Once the MYSQL is deployed

 You can log into the instance as ubuntu using either the password you set when you created the instance or with an SSH key if you added one during creation.

You can then switch the user to root without a password by entering the following command,
~~~
sudo su -
~~~

 The MySQL root password is stored under **/root/.mysql_root_password**

 Login to MySQL using the command,
 ~~~
 mysql -u root -p <$password stored in the above file>
 ~~~

 You can access phpMyAdmin immediately by visiting the Instance’s IP address in your browser followed by **/phpmyadmin**

 You will be prompted for the first login, which we have created for security purposes. 

 The user name is **"admin"**

 The Phpmyadmin password is stored under **/root/.phpmyadmin_password**

 The web root is **/var/www/html**

 To secure your connection, you will need a registered domain configured for your Instance.
